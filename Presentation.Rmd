## What is Preterm Birth? Why it is an important issue?

-	Preterm birth (PTB): is defined as a birth before 37 weeks of pregnancy.
-	It is the leading cause of infant mortality in the U.S. 
-	In 2013, PTB accounted for 36% of U.S. infant deaths in their first year of life. 
-	In addition to the monetary cost of PTB, which exceeds 25 billion dollars annually and these babies may suffer from life-long deficiencies. 

## Objective and Research Questions

I want to investigates the risk factors of preterm birth (PTB) in the largest obstetric population that has ever been studied in this field.

I would like to address two research questions:

-	What risk factors are the most important predictors of preterm birth? More specifically, what combination of risk factors increases the chance of preterm birth? 
-	What is the chance of a preterm birth given the presence of a number of risk factors? 

## Data Source

-	The 2016 U.S. linked birth dataset is obtained and combined with two other area- level datasets, Area Health Resources File and County Health Ranking.
-	A cohort of 3.4 million singleton deliveries 
-	All datasets were linked using a common geographical identifier, the FIPS county codes.
-	I performed the data cleaning and preparation in STATA 14.0 and the processing has been coded in R 3.6.0. 
-	These datasets have a total of 300 variables. After the initial data cleaning, 77 influential variables remained. 
-	These variables can be classified into the categories of geographical, behavioral, and demographical information of parents, as well as mothersâ€™ health status (e.g., history of hypertension, diabetes, sexually transmitted disease, and body mass index). 

## Visualization

-	Data visualization is a challenging task in this study due to the large number of observations. 
-	We used Violin graphs from the ggplot2 package in R to plot the data and gain more information about the features and their relationship with preterm birth. 

## Violin Graph

```{r, out.width = "300px"}
knitr::include_graphics("image2.png")
```

## Method

- The distribution of the response variable is imbalanced. Preterm birth in singleton pregnancies occurs only in eight percent of the deliveries and the remaining are full-term. 
- Multicollinearity issue within the dataset.

## Multicollinearity

```{r, out.width = "300px"}
knitr::include_graphics("image3.png")
```

## Method
-	we are interested in finding the significant interactions among the variables. 
-	our dataset has 3.6 million records with 77 variables and 20 categorical variables. 

**Based on these four characteristics, I will apply random forest, gradient boosting machines (GBM), and XGboost**

## Takeaway (Who gets benefit from the results?)

- Reducing the total PTB rate will results in billion dollars cost saving for the healthcare system.
- It also, prevents life-long deficiencies for preterm babies.
- The result of our work would be helpful for physicians and practitioners with specialty in ObGyn as well as policymakers at both state and national level.
